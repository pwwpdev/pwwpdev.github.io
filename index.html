        <h1>Power Workplace</h1>
        <p>Power Workplace was founded in 2017 with the ambition to accelerate the world’s transition to future-of-work by empowering organizations with technologies needed to transform their workplace experiences in smart offices, smart buildings, and smart campuses.</p>
        
        <p>Founded in Hong Kong by industry leading experts across cloud computing, audio-visual engineering, and the Internet-of-Things space, Power Workplace has designed, built, and managed workplace solutions globally for our customers through the integration of sensors, real-time analytics, open access platforms, and UI/UX development to empower the next generation of workplace strategy formation.</p>
        
        <p>Our customers include global banks, global insurers, “big 4” professional accountancy firms, and top ranked universities.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Power Workplace was conceived during a time when integration of workplace sensors and a productivity suite was a rarity. Our first project for a global insurance firm was completed in 2018 incorporating thousands of occupancy sensors with Office 365 and a new UI/UX development for an employee engagement application to speed up adoption of hot desks and bookable spaces.</p>
        
        <p>Our initial success generated the momentum needed to innovate our solutions as well as curating the “best-of-breed” hardware products and technologies for the future generation of workplace strategy.</p>

        <h2>Today and Beyond</h2>
        <p>Today, with over 70,000 sensing spaces deployed and managed, we support over 50,000+ users worldwide and have been recognized as a leader in workplace technologies design and integration.</p>
        
        <p>Power Workplace is partnering with global facilities managers, technology solutions providers, cloud service providers, sensing hardware vendors, and interior design consultants to deliver a truly integrated and future-proof solution for every scenario at work.</p>
